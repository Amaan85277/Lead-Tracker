# Lead-Tracker

A simple chrome extension that allows you to save your leads on your project works.

Tapping on "SAVE TAB", saves the current tab in the directory.

Tapping on "SAVE INPUT", saves the input that we feed in the space given, as a link.

These links can be directly accessed from the extension itself, as it keeps on storing the information in itself.


While if you want to delete all your leads. for example, starting a new project.
You just have to double click on "DELETE ALL" to delete  all the references.


And there is no need to worry about the links vanishing the moment you close chrome.
Until you don't delete all the links. The links will remain.

THANK YOU!
